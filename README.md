This repository contain the python code for machine learning of Li-ion battery classification.
The dataset contains data about the physical and chemical properties of the 
Li-ion silicate cathodes which can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/crystal-system-properties-for-liion-batteries/code

The main goal is to use these properties to predict the class of the considered Li-ion battery.
These batteries can be classified on the basis of their crystal system.
Three major classes of crystal system include: monoclinic, orthorhombic and triclinic.
